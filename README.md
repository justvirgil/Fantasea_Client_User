## About The Project

<div align="left">

<pre>
This is the first mobile application I made and was done to demonstrate the utilization of CRUD that was presented later as a project.

It works like a booking application where a client needs to complete the process of booking a pump-boat that offers a specific activity or event in a
selected island or place.

I also have the pump-boat user application in different repository =)
